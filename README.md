# Simple-GraphQL-Server

# How to run
Install these following dependencies to create an express nodejs server and graphQL: `npm install --save express graphql express-graphql`.

Since there is no database involved, a dummy dataset will be used under the name `Mock_data.json`.

There will be only 1 API end-point used in this small project, which is under `http://localhost:8080/graphql`. A GraphQL GUI is also enabled, which is GraphiQL, to aid in querying.
